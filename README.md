# Basic Banking System

Welcome to the Basic Banking System project, developed as part of The Sparks Foundation Web Development Internship! This web application enables the transfer of virtual currency among multiple users while meticulously recording all banking transactions.

## Overview

The Basic Banking System provides a simulated environment for managing virtual transactions between users. Here's a brief overview of its key features:

1. **Dummy Data Initialization**: The system starts with a predefined set of dummy data stored in a database. This data includes information for up to 10 customers, such as their names, email address, and current balances.

2. **Customer Management**: Each customer is represented in the database with essential details like name, email, and current balance. This information is accessible and modifiable through the system's user interface.

3. **Transaction Tracking**: The system maintains a comprehensive record of all transactions. Every transfer of virtual currency between users is logged, providing a transparent view of the banking activities.

## User Flow

Here's a step-by-step guide to navigating through the Basic Banking System:

1. **Home Page**: Upon accessing the website, users are greeted with the homepage, which serves as the entry point to the system.

2. **View All Customers**: Users can explore the list of all registered customers. This feature provides an overview of the customer base and their respective account details.

3. **Select and View Customer**: By clicking on a specific customer from the list, users can view detailed information about that customer, including their current balance.

4. **Transfer Money**: Users have the option to initiate a fund transfer. They can select the customer they wish to send money to and specify the amount. The system ensures the integrity of each transaction, updating balances accordingly.

5. **View Transaction History**: A dedicated section displays the complete history of transactions. Users can track the flow of virtual currency over time, enhancing transparency and accountability.
